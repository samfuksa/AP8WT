    <p>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA Apple today announced iPhone 16e, a new addition to the iPhone 16 lineup that offers
        powerful capabilities at a more affordable price. iPhone 16e delivers fast, smooth performance and breakthrough
        battery life, thanks to the industry-leading efficiency of the A18 chip and the new Apple C1, the first cellular
        modem designed by Apple. iPhone 16e is also built for Apple Intelligence, the intuitive personal intelligence
        system that delivers helpful and relevant intelligence while taking an extraordinary step forward for privacy in
        AI. The 48MP Fusion camera takes gorgeous photos and videos, and with an integrated 2x Telephoto, it is like
        having two cameras in one, so users can zoom in with optical quality. When outside of cellular and Wi-Fi
        coverage, Apple’s groundbreaking satellite features — including Emergency SOS, Roadside Assistance, Messages,
        and Find My via satellite — help iPhone 16e users stay connected and get assistance when it matters most.1
        iPhone 16e will be available in two elegant matte finishes — black and white — with colorful cases available to
        accessorize. Pre-orders begin Friday, February 21, with availability beginning Friday, February 28.
        “iPhone 16e packs in the features our users love about the iPhone 16 lineup, including breakthrough battery
        life, fast performance powered by the latest-generation A18 chip, an innovative 2-in-1 camera system, and Apple
        Intelligence,” said Kaiann Drance, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide iPhone Product Marketing. “We’re so
        excited for iPhone 16e to complete the lineup as a powerful, more affordable option to bring the iPhone
        experience to even more people.”</p>
